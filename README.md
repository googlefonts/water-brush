# Water Brush

It's cool and refreshing. Water Brush is a contemporary script style. The dry brush texture is indicative of a camel hair brush filled with color on a watercolor textured paper. The characters are loose and expressiveâ€” perfect for casual and sophisticated situations.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the this command:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yml
```
